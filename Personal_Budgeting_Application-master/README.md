# Personal_Budgeting_Application
Budgeting is creating a plan to spend your money. Good budgeting is spending less than
you are earning as you plan for your financial goals. Budgeting is the fundamental step
in achieving financial literacy, and by extension, reaching financial security and freedom.
Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend and invest your hard earned money
wisely to meet your personal and financial goals in life. It should not be a mathematical
exercise that we think we have to endure; rather, it is the result of self-assessment of our
relationship with money and a necessary road map to steer us toward a higher standard
and quality of living.
# Abstract
Budgeting is the most basic and effective tool for managing our monthly income. But
most people avoid doing it because they think keeping a record of budget or expense is
a hectic task. Recording monthly expenses on paper are very difficult as modification,
removal, and searching are not easy on paper. Similarly using any which run on our
computers like MS excel or any other tool is also clumsy. Because we will have to note all
expenses on paper then later record them all on the tool installed on a computer. Better
solutions is to use mobile applications to keep a record of every expense easily at any
location. In this project, the task is to develop an Android-based application that will
be used to manage personal budget.

Personal Budgeting Application is exactly how much money you have and where it’s
being spent. A budget can help you find ways to save money and plan for the future.
Since budgeting allows you to create a spending plan for your money, it ensures that you
will always have enough money for the things you need and the things that are important
to you. Following a budget or spending plan will also keep you out of debt or help you
work your way out of debt if you are currently in debt.
Therefore, budgeting can be a way to improve your life. Debt management and other
personal financial tasks are made easier if proper budgeting is in place.
